		<h1>Building the Legal Barriers to Torture</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="intro" class="body-text-container">
		<p>
			The Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT) envisions a world without torture or ill-treatment. 
			To achieve this goal, we help countries develop and adopt legal frameworks, policies and practices that 
			reduce the risks of torture.
		</p>
		<p>
			We've identified seven legal measures that indicate a commitment to preventing torture. 
			These measures fall into three categories:
		</p>
		<div id="ind-list">
			<!--International standards drop downs-->
			<p class="ind-category">International standards developed by the United Nations (UN)</p>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind1_uncat">UN Convention against Torture</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					In 1984, the Member States of the UN adopted the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
					Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They sought to provide the world with a robust international 
					treaty that would reaffirm the absolute prohibition of torture under any circumstances. The Convention defines 
					torture and outlines measures to prohibit, prevent, and protect against the risk of torture.
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">
					Individual States can ratify the Convention to indicate their consent to 
					to be bound to and implement the Convention's measures.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind2_opcat">UN Optional Protocol</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					In 2002, the Member States of the UN adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
					With this Optional Protocol, they sought to complement the Convention against Torture with measures 
					focused on the prevention of torture.
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">
					As with the Convention against Torture, we assess whether individual States have ratified the 
					Optional Protocol.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind3_report">Report for the Committee against Torture (CAT)</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					The UN Convention against Torture established the Committee against Torture (CAT), an international body of 
					experts responsible for supervising the implementation of the Convention by the States that have ratified it. 
					As part of this review process, the States have to submit their official report explaining how they implement the Convention. 
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">				
					We note whether each State has submitted their initial report to the CAT.
				</p>
			</div>
			<!--Domestic law dropdowns-->
			<p class="ind-category">Domestic law</p>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind4_constitution">Prohibiting torture in the constitution</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					The Constitution of a country is the most important official, legal text that sets the principles, 
					the structure and organisation of the State, its main institutions and their relationships 
					(e.g. relations between the government and the Parliament). Because torture is a severe human rights violation, 
					States are encouraged to show their willingness to eradicate it by stating clearly in their Constitution that it 
					is prohibited.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind5_law_level_2">Criminalising torture in domestic law</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					Domestic law refers to any law or regulation adopted by a state, being applicable all over its territory. 
					It may comprise criminal and civil legislation, along with other subjects. An important obligation for States 
					parties to the Convention against Torture is to prohibit, criminalize and punish torture under domestic 
					law (often in the criminal law or code). 
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">
						We assess whether each State has fully or partially criminalised torture.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!--Oversight systems dropdowns-->
			<p class="ind-category">Oversight systems</p>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind6_npm_level_2">National Preventive Mechanism</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					The States parties to the Optional Protocol have the obligation to establish independent institutions called 
					"national preventive mechanisms" (NPMs) whose mandate is to prevent torture. To do so, they monitor 
					places of detention - such as prisons, police stations, and immigration detention centers - where torture is most 
					likely to occur.
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">
					There are multiple steps to implementing NPMs. The first is designating 
					an NPM, which decrees which institution takes on this mandate. However, an 
					NPM is not fully implemented until it has become operational and can 
					conduct monitoring visits, make reports and recommendations, and enter into dialogue with authorities. 
					We note whether a State's NPM is both designated and operational or designated only.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion accordion-ind" id="accordion-ind7_paris">National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) that meets the Paris Principles</button>
			<div class="div-panel">
				<p class="panel-ind">
					National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) are State bodies with the mandate to protect and promote human rights in their countries. 
					Although established by the State, they operate independently from the State and the government. 
				</p>
				<p class="panel-ind">
					In 1993, the UN General Assembly adopted the Paris Principles, which require NHRIs to be fully independent 
					and to comply with other principles such a broad mandate and functions, pluralism of members, adequate powers 
					and resources, and cooperative methods. We assess whether a State's NHRI fully complies with these principles.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			In the past 40 years, more and more States have adopted and implemented these measures, 
			thus increasing the legal barriers to torture around the world.
